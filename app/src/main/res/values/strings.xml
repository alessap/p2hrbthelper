        This app helps the annoying disconnection issue that happens between
        Android 10 and Pebble 2 SE and HR. By trial and error, users have found that forgetting the
        Pebble from the Bluetooth paired device list triggers the pairing on the watch which
        connects the device once again. Instead of manually doing so, this apps
        checks if the Pebble is paired and disconnected, and forgets it in the background so the
        only thing left to do is to accept the pairing on your Pebble.
